# Okta SSO Integration Basic Config

This is an example of a basic configuration of this module.

## Usage

To run this example, first you will need to configure both [cyral](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cyralinc/cyral/latest) and [okta](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/okta/okta/latest/docs) providers. After that, you can just execute the following commands from within this directory:

```bash
terraform init
terraform apply
```

Lastly, if you want to delete the resources created by this example, just execute a `terraform destroy` command.
